\chapter{Multi-core Programming}
Developing and distributing effective software is one of the most important concerns of today's software-driven fields. Effective software is surely needed in almost every part of embedded systems, especially in the fields of automotive, robotics, defense, transportation, electrical instruments, autonomous and cyber-physical systems. Quality software involvement in fields such as the ones that are mentioned created a great demand for parallel software development in the last ten years. This great demand caused software engineers in especially IT and embedded system sector to study parallel computing along with multi- and many- core systems.

The digitalization of almost every aspect of our lives as we know it requires systems to be more and more complex each passing day. While some years ago the computers had single-core processors, today almost every single computer has at least a couple of cores in their processors. The advancements in processors allowed development of more advanced systems with efficient software. The super computers currently NASA (The National Aeronautics and Space Administration) uses for collecting information are said to record as much data as it has been collected in the entire the world history in just four years. This example should show that how complex applications can be in the century we are living in. Furthermore, one of the most trending topics Cloud Computing, which is being studied to make use of complex computing power of super computers' remotely to public users, is being researched and it will benefit greatly from the advancements in the field of parallel computing.

While the usage of parallel computing is used for achieving more complex software, it is also widely used in more basic and cheap multi-core processors in order to achieve more tasks with less resource consumption and cost. Furthermore, with an efficient software distributed efficiently to a processor's cores, one could also make use of less energy consumption features by applying techniques such as under-clocking a processor. To summarize, developing efficient parallel software is not only useful in achieving advanced computing capability but also can help to achieve less energy and resource consumption, thus decreasing the cost of systems and making them more environment-friendly.

Origins of parallel software
Systems are becoming more and more complex
Recent studied areas such as cloud computing and IoT will benefit greately from the advancements in effective parallelization, for sure.
Systems have many cores nowadays
Even with shittiest hw system, a great sw distribution can achieve complex systems
Our systems benefit not only from energy consumption, but also hardware cost, resource usage
But in doing so, system should deliver a great performance still.
