@TODO:
Currently no access solution found to the bluez, apart form this low level, C-based variant through sdptool, or a D-Bus based solution 

To compile the server program:
gcc -o bluez_server /home/pi/Documents/bluez_server.c -lbluetooth -I/home/pi/Documents

To execute:
/home/pi/Documents/bluez_server

The sdptool is broken with the new BlueZ5 server.
Please, follow the links below, to make the server program work.
The solutions are temporary, the changes are lost after every restart.

Step 1. --- Reverts after every updates:

# nano /etc/systemd/system/dbus-org.bluez.service
ExecStart=/usr/lib/bluetooth/bluetoothd --compat
# systemctl daemon-reload
# systemctl restart bluetooth

Step 2. -- Reverts after every restart

# chmod 777 /var/run/sdp
